This is a simple 2D drawing and construction tool.

Written in the Nim programming language using GTK4, Cairo, Pango.

The tool is in a very early stage still.

Currently the focus is on the EDA schematic and PCB usage. Schematics creation,
layer assignment, and PCB rubberband routing works in principle, but making
it a useful tool is still much work. But not that difficult.
