This is a simple 2D drawing and construction tool.

Written in the Nim programming language using GTK4, Cairo, Pango.

The tool is in a very early stage still.

This tool shall provide the basic functionality for various CAD (Computer aided design)
and EDA (electronic design automation) related tools.

Some existing tools, i.e. the gEDA/PCB suite, suffer from issues like

- complicated usage
- ugly look
- large, complicated source code

This project was initially started in 2010 to replace the gschem schematics editor of the gEDA tool suite.
The initial attempt was written in Ruby using GTK, Cairo, and Pango for the GUI. Trying to be compatible with the
legacy gschem/PCB file format made the program a bit restricted and complicated, and the Ruby programming language was not really the ideal choice
 due to low performance and dynamic typing. In the last years some new programming languages became available which
 provide high performance, high level language constructs and good readability. We decided to use the Nim language, but there are
 some alternatives now.
 
As GUI we are using still GTK with Cairo and Pango for drawing. Using GTK makes some sense as our main target system
is Linux. Currently we are using Cairo for the vector drawing and Pango for text rendering. Cairo is known to be not very fast, but
offers good quality and has the advantage of providing SVG and PDF backends. Later we may use Blend2d as a faster cairo substitute
or maybe OpenGL based libraries like SDL2.

The main goals for this tool are

- nice, clean look
- really simple usage
- short, easy source code

The nice clean looks follows from the use of GTK4 and Cairo/Pango, as long as we do not pollute the GUI with too many
widgets and dialog windows. And we avoid highlighting selected elements with a single selection color, which is
a very unnatural way. Instead we use a brighter color with shadow effects.

The Nim programming language makes it possible to write short and easy to understand source code.

For the simple usage of the tool we try to make the user interaction as natural as possible, and we try
to avoid modal behaviour. All common basic operations should be available without a need for mode changes
or of opening of additional dialog windows.

Later the tool may get various skins, i.e. a mechanical CAD skin, a schematics editor skin and a PCB layout tool skin.
The PCB layout editor will be supported by a topological rubberband autorouter, so that not much special functionality will be
needed. 

In this early stage of the tool we do not care much about the exact layout of the GUI -- we just put
needed widgets somewhere on the screen. Later we will group the widgets, and we may display
different widget sets for the various skins of the tool.

== Basic usage

NOTE: This is a description of the intended usage. Most of it will not work yet.

As this tool is in a very early stage still there is no package manager support. On a Linux box with GTK libs
and Nim compiler installed you may try this tool in this way:

----
nimble install gintro
git clone https://github.com/stefansalewski/SDT.git
cd SDT
nim c --gc:arc sdt.nim
./sdt
----

Currently we start the tool from terminal without arguments. On startup a drawing area with nominal
size 600 x 400 is created. At the top of the window we have a set of different widgets. The GtkEntry right to
the computer screen pictogram is used to change the size and position of the available drawing area.
We can enter coordinates this way:

----
s
sx sy
x1 y1 +s
x1 y1 +sx +sy
x1 y1 x2 y2
----

The numeric values are float or integer literals separated by whitespace, comma or semicolon.

One single number gives an area of that size with start coordinates set to zero, and two literals
specify a x and y extent. When we enter two ordinary literals and one or two values starting with a plus character, then
the first two numbers specify the origin of the coordinate system and the values starting with the plus
specify the extent. And finally, when we give four ordinary values, then these are the lower and upper
x, y coordinates.

The coordinate origin is currently the left upper edge of the window, but later we may make
the origin location customizable.

On the right side of the grid button there is a similar GtkEntry widget that is used to select the actual grid size.
We use a large and a small grid, which can be set to different vales for x and y direction. You may enter literal
values like

----
S
Sx Sy
Sx sx Sy sy
----

for large grid size, large x/y grid size and full spezification. If you do not give the small grid,
it is set to one tenth of the large one. The toggle button left to this GtkEntry determines if the
large or small grid is currently active. When you draw shapes or move elements, the position
snaps to grid points.

== Entering shapes

Currently these shapes are available: Line, rectangle, circle, path and text. You select one of then 
by use ofvthe GtkCombobox.

Line: Click with LMB on the start position, move the mouse and click on the end position.
You can move the whole line or one of the line endpoints by a grab operation: Move the mouse
pointer over the line segment or over one of its endpoints, press the LMB, move the mouse and release the LMB.

Rectangle: Click on a position to specify one corner, move the mouse and press click again to
specify the opposite rectangle corner. You can resize the rectangle by grabbing its sides or its corners.

Circle: Click on the desired center, move the mouse and click on a point on its desired radius.

Path: Click on a start position, move the mouse, click to define the next point. Click again
on the last entered point to terminate the operation. As for the line, you can grab
the whole path or points of the path to modify the position or the shape.

Text: Click into the drawing area to start entering the text. A GtkEntry will
grab focus, and entered text is printed on the drawing area. You can use the
cursor keys to navigate in the string and the delete key to delete characters.
Press enter to terminate the text input operation.

=== Issues

A click with the LMB on an element selects it -- later we will need this selection for special operations.
As the mouse click is absorbed for selection, we can not start a line on an existing object. Current solution is that
first click selects the element, and second click starts the new line. Maybe later we will find a better solution?

== Styles

We have decided to avoid the use of multiple independent attributes for objects
like line width and color, but use predefined and user defined styles instead.
The reason is, that i.e. for creating  nice looking diagrams it is not a good idea to
choose random color values and line width independently. But it is better
to have some styles like default, thin, thick, headline. For tool skins like PCB or schematic
editor this is even more true, we would use a style net, pin, frame, label and such.
Using styles avoids a cluttered look and makes it easy to modify the whole
diagram, maybe by increasing the line width of the default style from 0.2mm to 0.5mm.

The use of styles is currently restricted, you can select one from the ComboBox, but we
can not yet create new styles.

== Generating new styles -- as intended

We just enter the name of the new style in a GtkEntry widget. Parameters of new style
like color, line width and font are used from corresponding property widgets and a
new style is appended to the styles GtkComboBox.

== Style parameters

We have a widget set to select a color, font, linewidth and such. These values are applied when we create
new styles, or the values are used direct when style None is selected.

== Groups

Single objects can be grouped so that they behave like a single entity. You can select
some elements and then select "create group" from the pulldown menu. This works currently
only for lines and circles.

== Layers 

Later we will get layer support. We will be able to look layers, make layers invisible
and move objects from one layer to a different one.
